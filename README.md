- Hi, I’m Min Yi Chen
- I’m interested in doodling and trying anything new
- I’m currently learning how to do reflective/personal journaling
- I'm originally from somewhere in China
- I'm a JUNIOR in Computer Engineering
- I chose my major because I want to use technology as a way to support others (in what way I'm not sure yet)
- A fun fact about me is: I can't whistle so I use a high pitched squeak to get someone's attention
- What do I want to learn from EE 205? Just all that it has to offer really
- A book or movie I'd recommend is: The Atlas Trilogy (3rd book isn't released yet but the first two are AMAZING)
